# Ð¡ollatz conjecture
This is a repo with an *experimental* proof of [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) for some segment of numbers. 

### Info 
The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.  
The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.  
It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term.  
If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.  
The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.

As of April 2021, all natural numbers up to and including **9,789,690,303,392,599,179,037** have been tested, and each of them has demonstrated compliance with the Collatz hypothesis.
